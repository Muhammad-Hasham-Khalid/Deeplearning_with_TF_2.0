mnist normal images Dataset
mnist fashion dataset
How does a NN work?
Scalar, vector, matrix, 2d, 3d data

Convert data to vector is called vectorization

Back propagation 
Front Propagation
optimizer
loss function

Classes and Labels:
Tabular form of data (columns - features)
input 
output (labels)

Table - Dataset : (population)
Training Dataset
Testing Dataset (for Evaluation of accuracy)
Validation Data

a row is called sample/record
every sample has a label (input - output)

ML problems:
Classification problem (image - labels)
where there is a discrete value for output is classification problem

Regression problem (continuous answers)

Clustering problem (unsupervised learning, data divided into clusters)

Discuss Data sets for Practical:


datasets :
mnist (7000 images, labels, handwritten digits)
6000 images (training)
1000 images (testing)

Accuracy:
True positive
True negative
False positive
False negative

mnist fashion (7000 images, labels, clothes images, images are grayscale)

grayscale images = ( R + G + B ) / 3
easy to be trained

Y = WX + B
w , b ==> weights
x     ==> input
y     ==> output

activation functions:
eyes and ears get many data but only relevant details go to the brain for processing (this is similar to activation function)

Confusion Matrix: (for accuracy)

True positive:
    it was positive and was predicted correctly as positive
True negative:
    it was negative and was predicted correctly as negative
False positive:
    it was positive and was predicted wrong
False negative:
    it was negative and was predicted wrong
